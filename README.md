A **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** chatbot that answers questions about the **Star Wars universe** using structured data from SWAPI (Star Wars API). Built with **LangChain**, **Gemini**, and **Gradio**, this chatbot combines semantic search and generative AI for accurate, lore-consistent responses.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The Star Wars RAG Chatbot enables users to:

- **Explore Star Wars lore**: Ask questions about characters, films, planets, starships, vehicles, and species.  
- **Semantic retrieval**: Uses vector embeddings to fetch contextually relevant passages from the knowledge base.  
- **RAG-powered responses**: Integrates Google's Gemini model for detailed and immersive answers.  
- **Interactive web interface**: Chat-style interface built with Gradio, accessible via web browser.

> Try asking questions like *"What is the height of Darth Vader?"* or *"Who directed The Empire Strikes Back?"* and get instant answers from the Jedi Archives.

## Project Purpose

This chatbot demonstrates how to build a knowledge-based question-answering system that combines:

- Structured data retrieval from SWAPI
- Vector embeddings for semantic search
- RAG architecture with Google's Gemini model
- Interactive web interface with Gradio

The project serves as both a practical example of modern NLP techniques and an educational tool for Star Wars fans.

## Dataset Description

The knowledge base of this project is built primarily from the **Star Wars API (SWAPI)**, a public API providing canonical Star Wars universe information. The dataset contains structured data for the following entities:

### 1. Characters (People)
- Name, height, mass, hair color, skin color, eye color, birth year, and gender.
- Examples: Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader, Yoda, Leia Organa.
- Data captures relationships such as species, homeworld, and appearances in films.

### 2. Films
- Title, episode number, director, producer, release date.
- Example: *A New Hope*, *The Empire Strikes Back*.
- This allows the chatbot to answer production-related questions.

### 3. Species
- Name, classification, designation, average height, average lifespan, language.
- Example: Wookiees, Ewoks, Humans, Droids.

### 4. Starships
- Name, model, manufacturer, cost, length, max speed, crew, passengers, cargo capacity.
- Example: Millennium Falcon, X-wing, Star Destroyer.

### 5. Vehicles
- Name, model, manufacturer, cost, length, crew, passengers, cargo capacity.
- Example: Sand Crawler, Speeder Bikes.

### 6. Planets
- Name, rotation period, orbital period, diameter, climate, gravity, terrain, surface water, population.
- Example: Tatooine, Alderaan, Hoth, Endor.

### Key Notes
- All API responses are converted into **natural language text passages** suitable for semantic search.
- Data preserves entity relationships, e.g., which characters appear in which films or which species belong to which planets.
- The dataset allows the RAG pipeline to retrieve **contextually relevant passages** for accurate, lore-consistent answers.

### Dataset Size
- The final dataset includes **hundreds of passages**: all characters, films, species, starships, vehicles, and planets indexed with embeddings.
- Stored in **Chroma vector database** for fast retrieval using semantic similarity search.


## Methods

The project implements a RAG pipeline with the following components:

1. Data Collection & Processing

   - Fetches data from SWAPI endpoints
   - Converts structured API responses to natural text passages
   - Preserves relationships between entities

2. Embeddings & Vector Store

   - Uses SentenceTransformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) for embeddings
   - Stores vectors in a Chroma database
   - Enables semantic similarity search

3. RAG Implementation

   - LangChain orchestrates the retrieval pipeline
   - Top-k relevant passages retrieved for each query
   - Context-aware responses using Gemini model

4. User Interface
   - Gradio web interface
   - Chat-style interaction
   - Real-time response generation

## Results

The chatbot successfully:

- Processes and indexes the complete SWAPI dataset
- Provides accurate answers to Star Wars-related questions
- Maintains conversation context
- Delivers responses with an engaging Jedi historian persona

Performance metrics:

- Response time: 2-5 seconds average
- Accurate information retrieval from the knowledge base
- Natural, contextual answers that stay true to Star Wars lore

## Example Questions

Here are some example questions you can ask the chatbot, organized by category. These questions demonstrate the range of information available through the SWAPI dataset:

### Characters and Biography

- "What is the height of Darth Vader?"
- "How much does Chewbacca weigh?"
- "What is Leia Organa's birth year?"
- "What color is Han Solo's hair?"
- "What gender is Yoda?"

### Films and Production

- "Who directed The Empire Strikes Back?"
- "When was A New Hope released?"
- "What is the episode number of Revenge of the Sith?"
- "Who produced Return of the Jedi?"

### Planets and Locations

- "What is the climate of Tatooine?"
- "How many residents does Alderaan have?"
- "What is the terrain of Hoth?"

### Ships and Technology

- "What is the model of the Millennium Falcon?"
- "Who pilots X-wing starships?"
- "What is the maximum speed of Star Destroyer?"

### Species and Culture

- "What is the average lifespan of Wookiees?"
- "What language do Ewoks speak?"
- "What is the classification of Humans in Star Wars?"

Each question is answered using information from the SWAPI database, enhanced with the chatbot's Jedi historian persona for an immersive experience.
